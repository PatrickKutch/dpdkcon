# dpdkcon

containerized dpdk generator

This contains two folders, one for creating the containeried DPDK sample applications and the other for DPDK-pktgen

These resulting containers are on dockerhub under patrickkutch

I make these for my own purposes, maybe they will be useful to you too.

There is a easy wrapper to launch the container with all of the mappings needed for DPDK in dpdkcon script file
